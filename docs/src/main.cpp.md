# C++ SDL2 RPG Game Main File Documentation

## Overview
This file (`main.cpp`) implements the main loop of a simple RPG game using SDL2. The program initializes SDL2, creates a window and renderer, and manages a game loop that continuously renders a `Player` object while handling events.

## Implementation Details

### SDL Initialization
```cpp
if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) != 0) {
    SDL_Log("Unable to initialize SDL: %s", SDL_GetError());
    return 1;
}
```
The program initializes SDL2 with `SDL_INIT_VIDEO` to enable video functionalities. If the initialization fails, an error message is logged, and the program exits.

### Creating the Window
```cpp
SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("RPG Game", SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                     SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 1080, 800, SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
```
A window titled "RPG Game" is created with a resolution of `1080x800` pixels. The window is resizable and centered on the screen.

### Creating the Renderer
```cpp
SDL_Renderer *renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, 0);
```
The renderer is created for rendering graphics onto the window. If the renderer creation fails, the program logs an error and exits.

### Main Game Loop
```cpp
bool isRunning = true;
SDL_Event event;
Player player(0, 0);

while (isRunning) {
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
        if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
            isRunning = false;
        }
    }
```
The game loop runs continuously while `isRunning` is true. Events are polled to check for user inputs or window events. If the `SDL_QUIT` event is received (e.g., when the user closes the window), the loop exits.

### Rendering Process
```cpp
std::cout << "Player Position: " << player.getPosY() << std::endl;

SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 0, 0, 0);
SDL_RenderClear(renderer);
player.render(renderer);
SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
```
The rendering process involves:
1. Printing the player's position.
2. Setting the render draw color to black (`0,0,0,0`).
3. Clearing the screen.
4. Rendering the `Player` object.
5. Presenting the rendered frame to the screen.

### Delay to Control Frame Rate
```cpp
SDL_Delay(15);
```
A 15-millisecond delay is added to slow down the rendering process and reduce CPU usage.

### Cleanup and Exit
```cpp
SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
SDL_Quit();
```
Before exiting, SDL resources such as the renderer and window are destroyed to free memory, and SDL subsystems are shut down with `SDL_Quit()`.

## Dependencies
- SDL2 library (`#include <SDL.h>`) for graphics rendering.
- `player.h` (`#include "include/player.h"`) for handling player-related logic.
- Standard C++ libraries (`#include <iostream>`) for console output.

## Summary
This file sets up the core loop of an RPG game using SDL2. It initializes SDL, creates a window and renderer, manages a simple event loop, renders a `Player` object, and ensures proper cleanup upon exit. Further improvements can include handling keyboard input, adding game mechanics, and improving rendering performance.
